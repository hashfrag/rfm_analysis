<em>Table Total Rows: <strong>541909</strong> </em><br><br>

Dataset has a lot of Null CustomerIDs, Negative Quantity Values (that were used to apply discounts or fix accounting errors), Null item descriptions, and all user order items were shown individually (same customerID could have 100 rows for one order).

<details><summary><strong>Data Preparation</strong></summary><br>

<strong>Started off with initial data cleaning, aggregation, and Recency | Frequency | Monetary value calculations:</strong>

    SELECT  
        CustomerID,
        Country,
        DATE_DIFF('2011-12-01' , CAST(MAX(InvoiceDate) AS DATE), DAY) AS recency,
        COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNO) AS frequency,
        SUM(UnitPrice*Quantity) AS monetary
    FROM  `tc-da-1.turing_data_analytics.rfm` AS original_table
    WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-12-01' AND '2011-11-30'
        AND CustomerID IS NOT NULL
        AND Quantity > 0 
        --Filtered out all of negative values for Monetary calculation that would result in negative numbers.
    GROUP BY CustomerID, Country
<em>
In WHERE clause I've set the time boundaries, filtered entries with no CustomerIds attached, and only showed entries where a positive amount of items were sold to avoid negative values. <br>
In GROUP BY clause I've grouped date to show combined R,F,M values for each individual user.<br>
In SELECT statement I've calculated:<br>
* Recency with Date Difference function by subtracting the latest order date of the customer from predetermined hypothetical current date).<br>
* Frequency by COUNTing all distinct InvoiceIDs each customer had.<br>
* Monetary value by adding up all purchases.</em><br><br>


<strong>With now acquired Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each user, I've set quartile ranges that will be used for assigning scores later on:</strong>

    WITH  rfm_values AS (
        SELECT  
            CustomerID,
            Country,
            DATE_DIFF('2011-12-01' , CAST(MAX(InvoiceDate) AS DATE), DAY) AS recency,
            COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNO) AS frequency,
            SUM(UnitPrice*Quantity) AS monetary
        FROM  `tc-da-1.turing_data_analytics.rfm` AS original_table
        WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-12-01' AND '2011-11-30'
            AND CustomerID IS NOT NULL
            AND Quantity > 0 
            --Filtered out all of negative values for Monetary calculation that would result in negative numbers.
        GROUP BY CustomerID, Country )

    SELECT--Recency Quartiles Calculation
        APPROX_QUANTILES(Recency, 4)  [OFFSET(1)] AS r25,
        APPROX_QUANTILES(Recency, 4)  [OFFSET(2)] AS r50,
        APPROX_QUANTILES(Recency, 4)  [OFFSET(3)] AS r75,
        --Frequency Quartiles Calculation
        APPROX_QUANTILES(Frequency, 4)[OFFSET(1)] AS f25,
        APPROX_QUANTILES(Frequency, 4)[OFFSET(2)] AS f50,
        APPROX_QUANTILES(Frequency, 4)[OFFSET(3)] AS f75,
        --Monetary Quartiles Calculation
        APPROX_QUANTILES(Monetary, 4) [OFFSET(1)] AS m25,
        APPROX_QUANTILES(Monetary, 4) [OFFSET(2)] AS m50,
        APPROX_QUANTILES(Monetary, 4) [OFFSET(3)] AS m75
    FROM rfm_values


<strong>Using the now set quartile ranges, I've assigned each user their R,F,M scores from 1-4 (4 being the highest):</strong>

       WITH  rfm_values AS (
       SELECT  
             CustomerID,
             Country,
             DATE_DIFF('2011-12-01' , CAST(MAX(InvoiceDate) AS DATE), DAY) AS recency,
             COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNO) AS frequency,
             SUM(UnitPrice*Quantity) AS monetary
       FROM  `tc-da-1.turing_data_analytics.rfm` AS original_table
       WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-12-01' AND '2011-11-30'
             AND CustomerID IS NOT NULL
             AND Quantity > 0 
             --Filtered out all of negative values for Monetary calculation that would result in negative numbers.
       GROUP BY CustomerID, Country ),
 
       quartiles AS (
       SELECT--Recency Quartiles Calculation
             APPROX_QUANTILES(Recency, 4)  [OFFSET(1)] AS r25,
             APPROX_QUANTILES(Recency, 4)  [OFFSET(2)] AS r50,
             APPROX_QUANTILES(Recency, 4)  [OFFSET(3)] AS r75,
             --Frequency Quartiles Calculation

             --Monetary Quartiles Calculation
             APPROX_QUANTILES(Monetary, 4) [OFFSET(1)] AS m25,
             APPROX_QUANTILES(Monetary, 4) [OFFSET(2)] AS m50,
             APPROX_QUANTILES(Monetary, 4) [OFFSET(3)] AS m75
       FROM rfm_values)


    SELECT 
        rfm_values.CustomerID,
        rfm_values.Country,
        rfm_values.Recency,
        rfm_values.Frequency,
        rfm_values.Monetary,
        -- Assigned Recency Quartiles
        CASE  WHEN rfm_values.Recency <= quartiles.r25 THEN 4
              WHEN rfm_values.Recency <= quartiles.r50 AND rfm_values.Recency > quartiles.r25 THEN 3
              WHEN rfm_values.Recency <= quartiles.r75 AND rfm_values.Recency > quartiles.r50 THEN 2
              ELSE 1 END AS R,
        -- Assigned Frequency Quartiles
        CASE  WHEN rfm_values.Frequency <= quartiles.f25 THEN 1
              WHEN rfm_values.Frequency <= quartiles.f50 AND rfm_values.Frequency > quartiles.f25 THEN 2
              WHEN rfm_values.Frequency <= quartiles.f75 AND rfm_values.Frequency > quartiles.f50 THEN 3
              ELSE 4 END AS F,
        -- Assigned Monetary Quartiles
        CASE  WHEN rfm_values.Monetary <= quartiles.m25 THEN 1
              WHEN rfm_values.Monetary <= quartiles.m50 AND rfm_values.Monetary > quartiles.m25 THEN 2
               WHEN rfm_values.Monetary <= quartiles.m75 AND rfm_values.Monetary > quartiles.m50 THEN 3
               ELSE 4 END AS M
      FROM rfm_values , quartiles

Those scores were then used in final customer segmentation. Iâ€™ve chosen to use RFM scores individualy for better detail instead of joining F and M scores together, because when trying to distinguish between loyal and big spending customers, combined FM score makes it not as accurate. 

The main segments are Best Customers, Loyal Customers, Big Spenders, High Potential and Low Potential Customers. The same ones apply for the At Risk category, but for the Lost segment I chose to show combined segments just for the High and Low Potential customers, as more in depth detail for that segment group seemed redundant. One outlier segment is in Active group, it being the New Customers segment.

In the outer query I added additional grouping for the segments, to be able to quickly identify Active, At Risk, and Lost customers.

<details><summary><strong>Analysis Results</strong></summary><br>
There are 4301 customers during the defined time period. 50% of those customers are still Active, 25% are currently At Risk of being Lost and the last 25% can be already considered as Lost. These customer groups are based on their last order recency. </br></br>
Active customers group is healthy. The average order recency is around 20 days, and frequency of orders is around 6 per user. Average revenue per user is also very high being at around 3000$. From all of these customers, only one segment needs more attention from us, those being the New Customers. They recently purchased something from us for the first time, and we should encourage them to come back.</br></br>

Customers that are currently At Risk have Average Order Recency of around 85 days. 3 Months from the last order is quite a long time, and some of those customers are quite valuable to the business, thus they need more attention from us, so that they would come back and shop with us again. </br></br>

<strong>Customer segments should be targeted in this order:</strong>
1. Best Customers and Big Spenders (At Risk). They result in the best monetary gains for the business, while having a smaller amount of people in those groups (lower amount of customers means less effort for the business while communicating with them). 
2. Loyal Customers (At Risk). While the monetary value acquired from them is not that great, the order frequency is very high. Plus there are only 41 customers in that segment. Keeping Loyal Customers is important for overall sustainability of the business.
3. High Potential Customers (At Risk). This is the biggest chunk of customers to try to get back, and there are 357 of them. They are the most average customers we have, but some of them have a lot of potential to be very good customers. 
4. New Customers. Not as important as the 4 segments above, but when those are dealt with, this would be the best next action.
* Low Potential Customers can be ignored until we do everything we can to get back the previously mentioned segments. Trying to get these customers will likely cost more to us than we will get in return from them.
